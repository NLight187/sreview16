I beg to differ as the ex-captain of my highschool team.\n\nYou make me angry, Prejudice. Not only do you belittle me as an athlete because I’m a female, my appearance seems to be of vital importance to you, though I don’t understand why you are concerned with my appearance. I cannot recall how it affects you in any way. If you happen to see me in a dress and heels with makeup on, you tell your friends that I’m trying too hard. If you see me bareface in comfortable clothes, you say that I’m not trying hard enough. What exactly do you want from me then? I don’t dress for you to criticize. I dress for my own satisfaction, not yours. I know that I cannot compare to the picture perfect beauties in your magazines, but let me tell you a little secret: magazine pictures are enhanced with digital software.\n\nMy choice in clothing is not the only aspect of my appearance that you judge. Prejudice, you often have ridiculous expectations and make assumptions about me because of my race. I cannot count how many times you have asked me, “Are you Chinese?” or try to convince me that Japan and China are one and the same. For your information, Japan and China are two different countries with a historically bloody relationship. You automatically think that academics comes naturally to everyone in my race. You wouldn’t know how much school stresses me out and how much effort I put into studying. You’re also always shocked about my perfect English. I don’t know why you expect my English to be poor because I’m not a foreigner; I grew up in New Jersey.\n\nPrejudice, at least when you stand alongside strangers, I have different means of releasing my frustration and anger. It’s much more difficult for me when you stand alongside the people I love, because I don’t know how to respond when you tempt the people precious to me into degrading strangers standing across the street. How do I respond when someone I love points out a tired looking man in dirty clothes and comments that the man is probably on drugs? This is all your fault, Prejudice. You corrupted their minds and I blame you for it. \n\nIt’s also strange when I feel your presence at family parties that you’re not welcome to. I rarely invite my friends to these parties because you make them uncomfortable with your presence. Eating habits, clothing choices, height, size, facial structure, and language are only a small portion of your judging criteria. You manipulate the people around me into consenting with your views and they are at your mercy. You’re the whispered insults and the crude jokes made about my friends’ weight; to which you expect me to laugh at, but I disappoint your expectations when I don’t. You’re the dirty looks given towards my friends who adorn tattoos and piercings and I know about your attempts in manipulating my parents into believing that my friends are terrible influences for my siblings and I. Unfortunately for you, I won’t fall victim to your games. I will choose who my friends are based solely on their character and nothing else.\n\nI do have to give you credit for your fairness though, Prejudice. You judge everyone equally negative. You base your judgements on the wrongdoings of the a problematic minority and automatically apply it to the innocent majority. For this reason, you believe that Catholics are mindless puppets of the Church and Atheists are cold-hearted with no morals. You neither think about the progressive Catholics nor the charitable Atheists. To you, the affluents do not deserve their wealth but the homeless deserve their poverty. You forget that not all wealthy individuals are filled with greed and not all homeless people are lazy. You don’t consider personal hardships people face when making your judgements. You dismiss the younger generations because of their lack of experience and ignore the elderly because they’re not current with the times. You make assumptions about certain groups of people because the innocent majority don’t matter to you, as long as they’re affiliated with the problematic minority in any form. No one can escape your scrutiny.\n\nPrejudice, you already know how much I hate you. I hate seeing you everywhere I go.You are in books, movies, and on social media. I hear you in the news and in the voices of strangers. What’s worse is that sometimes you appear on the faces of the people I love.

It was August 20, 2002, one of my last days of that year’s summer camp, when my father picked me up in our new family hauler — a dark red Honda CR-V that he and my mother affectionately named Rhonda. My first love. Rhonda the Honda. To say Rhonda was pretty would have to be said with strange facial contortions; it would be said through squinted eyes and a voice a few octaves higher than usual, usually accompanied by a shrug or six. But she was a Honda and that meant she was cheap and very reliable, something perfect for our little middle class family. She was a replacement for my mother’s fourteen-year-old Honda Civic, called Wanda the Honda, oddly enough. The only memory I had of Wanda was a huge spider crushed in one of the doors that literally mentally scarred me for life. No wonder I didn’t mind seeing Wanda go. Plus, now we had Rhonda. Rhonda would shoulder our burdens on long trips to Cooperstown, Boston, or even just the sandy shores of Stone Harbor.\n\nThe first car I fell in love with was my dad’s old Ford Escort station wagon he named Fred. Fred died on a hot summer day in 2006 at the Cherry Hill Mall parking lot. For some reason, I had to choke back tears while staring out of Rhonda’s back hatch as we drove away with a heat mirage rising up and enveloping Fred’s dark blue exterior. My parents spoke in hushed, angry tones in the front seats about the next thing to do; my father had to drive to a train station every day and my mother to her job at a local newspaper twenty minutes from home, so they needed two cars. I pressed my face up against Rhonda’s rear seat backs and watched as Fred grew smaller and smaller, letting the khaki-colored fabric imprint my skin with square shapes. At least we still had her. Her maroon exterior sparkled in the late August sun and her khaki-colored interior was firm yet warm; like a mother that pushes hard but is always there when times get tough.\n\nOwnership of Rhonda moved from my mother to my father when Fred died and my mother had bought a slightly used dark gray Toyota Corolla she named Gaston, after a now former Philadelphia Flyers goalie. Rhonda was getting up there in years now, but she showed no signs of malfunction. She was a Honda through and through and was built to withstand anything. She lived through hurricanes, ridiculous blizzards, and so much more. She had dings, scratches, cracks, and bad brakes, but she was ours.\n\nRhonda was special to me because of how long she was in my life. We got her when I was six and I sold her when I was twenty. That’s fourteen years of my life, seventy fucking percent of it, that I spent with Rhonda. She was there for the best and the worst parts of my life, from weddings to funerals and everything in between. She had taken me on dates and coddled me after breakups. She was a constant. I was sixteen when I learned to drive, and I did it in Rhonda. I was eighteen when she officially became mine, after my father bought a brand new Volkswagen hatchback for himself. I got a couple of clip-on window American flags to put on the rear windows and Rhonda became The Iron Patriot, going by Rhonda only to her close friends and family.\n\nShe had her quirks and that was part of the reason why she was so special to me. One such quirk was that the front two seat belts would only properly clasp if hit with the passenger’s wrist from a very specific angle. Another was that the rear passenger doors didn’t lock with the universal locking mechanism on the driver’s side, but rather had to be operated manually. That was what caused me to be locked out of the car in the middle of nowhere with no phone, shirt, or shoes for an hour and a half before I shattered a window, unlocked the door, and embarrassingly drove home.\n\nThe Iron Patriot accompanied me alone for roughly twenty-five thousand miles. She made appearances in different states, drove up and back to my best friend’s house in Freehold several times, and had many times undergone the stereotypical teenage rite of passage — backseat summer car sex. The Iron Patriot was especially important in the formation of a long distance relationship. I had met a girl staying in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for a few weeks and made the thirty-five-or-so-minute journey there and back a dozen or more times in those few weeks. The young woman and I laughed, kissed, fucked, and loved in The Iron Patriot. Bathed in her headlights, I tearfully bid this young woman goodbye for a few months before I would fly to her home state to visit her, leaving The Iron Patriot alone for five days to relax under a low autumn sun. The Iron Patriot, through all of this life experience, saw it all. They saw objects or places can sometimes become haunted if they see enough emotional anguish or energy, so I’d say that there’s a good shot that today some poor kid has a haunted, fourteen-year-old CR-V.\n\nNaturally, the aforementioned long distance relationship came to a close. It was late one Sunday night (or Monday morning, depending on your point of view) in early January. I was sitting in my car after a late, lone viewing of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning performance in *The Revenant.* My long term, long distance relationship was about to end. I knew it, and she knew it. We’d hardly spoken for six days. I decided that it was a good time to reach out and say “hey,” while sitting alone in my car at 1:30 in the morning.\n\n*Ring ring.* Nothing. Listening to the dial tone, I stared at the front of the theater through The Iron Patriot’s frost-covered windshield.\n\n*Ring ring.* Still nothing. Light snow had began to fall, reflecting color in all directions as it glided softly down in front of the theater’s blue neon letters.\n\n*Ring ri—* “Hello?” her voice sounded tired.\n\n“Hey,” I said back.\n\n“What’s up?”\n\n“I, uh, just got out of a movie. Thought I’d see what’s up.”\n\n“Thought you’d see what’s up, huh?”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n“Well, I just got into bed. I’ll talk to you later.”\n\n“Oh, uh…okay. Bye. I love y—” the line was dead.\n\nI threw my phone into the back seat and punched the ceiling of my poor Rhonda as hard as I could, making a slight dent. She was Rhonda to me that night, after an extremely intimate and emotional experience she and I shared together that I somehow coped with alone.\n\nI sat in the lot for a while, caressing my now-red knuckles and enjoying the silence and the snow. I watched the last of the cars pull out of the lot as a thin, powdery white built on Rhonda’s windshield wipers. I watched cracks in the asphalt fill up while the rest of the tarmac sat speckled and frozen like the crusted surface of an icy sea. I watched the neon blue letters spelling CARMIKE flicker and turn off as the snow piled softly on top of them. When it reached half an inch, I decided I’d stop wallowing in self-pity and go home. The world was cold, but life went on.\n\nThe next few months were weird. I was in school, sure, and working, but I got it in my head that I should start looking for a different car. Not a new one, I had an idea of what I wanted (preferably late-‘90s or early 2000s Hondas), but a different car. I knew I was going to be getting rid of The Iron Patriot. A few times I stopped and told myself I’d drive her until she died and I was *forced* to get rid of her, but the desire to get something else always won out. My parents were really on the side of me getting a new car too; they’d worried about their only child driving a fourteen-year-old crossover whose steering wheel shook past fifty miles an hour up and down the highway seven days a week all over and through the dips and bends of New Jersey. I can’t say that I blame them looking back.\n\nIn late May of last year, Honda’s newly redesigned Civic coupes went on sale. One of the colors was an obnoxious “energy green pearl” as deemed by Honda, and I was hooked. I was willing to get rid of my beloved Patriot for this green…thing. A Friday in early June my father accompanied me to a nearby Honda dealership where I would seal the deal. I was getting rid of Rhonda. I test drove this green Civic and was happy enough with it. It was fast (although fast to me after driving The Iron Patriot for three years could have been a wheelchair on ice), nimble, and quiet. I was sold. It would help me build credit. It was much better on gas, much more attractive, and way safer. What could go wrong? What was wrong with this plan? There was nary a doubt in my mind that this was the right call and so I decided to sell The Iron Patriot and use that money as a downpayment on this new Civic I had started to call Maxine.\n\nAbout three quarters of the way through the dealings, I was hit with incredible remorse. I was actually going to have to leave my Rhonda behind. My back was to the dealership’s outer windows where she sat in the rain, staring in at me. I made the mistake of turning around to look at her and started to sob. Not a quiet, remorseful sob, but rather a loud and ugly one. That car was the only thing besides my parents to be constant in my life for seventy percent of it. I sobbed harder and harder and still she sat staring at me, rain collecting on her windshield and hood. Her big, triangular headlights gleamed brightly at me as they became covered in rain. It looked like she was crying too. I couldn’t believe how attached I was to her; I never thought the day would come when I would actually have to get rid of my Rhonda. My father tried consoling me but it was no real use. I was a wreck. He was emotional too, but not making a scene the way I was.\n\nI had left the table to go clean myself up in the bathroom where a kind old mechanic helped to console me. I was rubbing my eyes at the sink and washing my face with cold water when I felt a large hand pat me on the shoulder.\n\n“You okay, son?” he asked me.\n\n“Y-Yeah,” I managed to stammer out. “I’m selling my first car. She’s been in my life for fourteen years.”\n\n“Oh,” he looked at me with soft compassion and then smiled faintly. “I’ll take care of her for you.”\n\nI looked at him and tried to muster up some positive emotion but couldn’t. He smiled again, looked down, and walked out.\n\nWhile startlingly kind for a stranger, his words only made me sob harder. I eventually cleaned myself up and walked back to our negotiating table, where Rhonda’s plates sat in the middle, warped and weathered, a startling contrast. I looked out the window to where she was parked and she was gone. My father had asked the people at the dealership to pull her away before we left so I wouldn’t have to drive past her, wet and alone, in my brand new spotless Civic that didn’t have issues with its locks or seat belts or its steering wheel shaking. It was very considerate and I still think it’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.\n\nI left the dealership that day in much better shape than I was in a few paragraphs ago, still sad but beguiled at how well equipped even base model cars are these days. My Civic, Maxine, is great. She drives wonderfully, is fun around corners, has a nice little growl to her, and currently does 36.1 miles per gallon, giving me approximately four hundred and thirty five miles to a tank. She’s pretty to look at and I always get compliments on her color, but she isn’t the CR-V. Not a day goes by where I don’t think of my Iron Patriot, Rhonda, the car that picked me up from summer camp at age six, that I grew up in, that was my own personal love shack from ages seventeen to twenty, that was simultaneously one of my closest friends and best nurturing figures. What I experience on a daily basis because of Rhonda is an emotion known on this world as “regret.” Her license plates hang next to my bed, warped and weathered, a reminder of the old days, as if I could ever forget.\n\nEveryone remembers their first love.\n","source":"Rhonda.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Rhonda\nauthor: Sam Lyons\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-rhonda.jpg\naccentimage: img/accent-image-rhonda.jpg\n---\nIn life, every American remembers two things — their first car and their first love.

It was August 20, 2002, one of my last days of that year’s summer camp, when my father picked me up in our new family hauler — a dark red Honda CR-V that he and my mother affectionately named Rhonda. My first love. Rhonda the Honda. To say Rhonda was pretty would have to be said with strange facial contortions; it would be said through squinted eyes and a voice a few octaves higher than usual, usually accompanied by a shrug or six. But she was a Honda and that meant she was cheap and very reliable, something perfect for our little middle class family. She was a replacement for my mother’s fourteen-year-old Honda Civic, called Wanda the Honda, oddly enough. The only memory I had of Wanda was a huge spider crushed in one of the doors that literally mentally scarred me for life. No wonder I didn’t mind seeing Wanda go. Plus, now we had Rhonda. Rhonda would shoulder our burdens on long trips to Cooperstown, Boston, or even just the sandy shores of Stone Harbor.</p>\n<p>The first car I fell in love with was my dad’s old Ford Escort station wagon he named Fred. Fred died on a hot summer day in 2006 at the Cherry Hill Mall parking lot. For some reason, I had to choke back tears while staring out of Rhonda’s back hatch as we drove away with a heat mirage rising up and enveloping Fred’s dark blue exterior. My parents spoke in hushed, angry tones in the front seats about the next thing to do; my father had to drive to a train station every day and my mother to her job at a local newspaper twenty minutes from home, so they needed two cars. I pressed my face up against Rhonda’s rear seat backs and watched as Fred grew smaller and smaller, letting the khaki-colored fabric imprint my skin with square shapes. At least we still had her. Her maroon exterior sparkled in the late August sun and her khaki-colored interior was firm yet warm; like a mother that pushes hard but is always there when times get tough.</p>\n<p>Ownership of Rhonda moved from my mother to my father when Fred died and my mother had bought a slightly used dark gray Toyota Corolla she named Gaston, after a now former Philadelphia Flyers goalie. Rhonda was getting up there in years now, but she showed no signs of malfunction. She was a Honda through and through and was built to withstand anything. She lived through hurricanes, ridiculous blizzards, and so much more. She had dings, scratches, cracks, and bad brakes, but she was ours.</p>\n<p>Rhonda was special to me because of how long she was in my life. We got her when I was six and I sold her when I was twenty. That’s fourteen years of my life, seventy fucking percent of it, that I spent with Rhonda. She was there for the best and the worst parts of my life, from weddings to funerals and everything in between. She had taken me on dates and coddled me after breakups. She was a constant. I was sixteen when I learned to drive, and I did it in Rhonda. I was eighteen when she officially became mine, after my father bought a brand new Volkswagen hatchback for himself. I got a couple of clip-on window American flags to put on the rear windows and Rhonda became The Iron Patriot, going by Rhonda only to her close friends and family.</p>\n<p>She had her quirks and that was part of the reason why she was so special to me. One such quirk was that the front two seat belts would only properly clasp if hit with the passenger’s wrist from a very specific angle. Another was that the rear passenger doors didn’t lock with the universal locking mechanism on the driver’s side, but rather had to be operated manually. That was what caused me to be locked out of the car in the middle of nowhere with no phone, shirt, or shoes for an hour and a half before I shattered a window, unlocked the door, and embarrassingly drove home.</p>\n<p>The Iron Patriot accompanied me alone for roughly twenty-five thousand miles. She made appearances in different states, drove up and back to my best friend’s house in Freehold several times, and had many times undergone the stereotypical teenage rite of passage — backseat summer car sex. The Iron Patriot was especially important in the formation of a long distance relationship. I had met a girl staying in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for a few weeks and made the thirty-five-or-so-minute journey there and back a dozen or more times in those few weeks. The young woman and I laughed, kissed, fucked, and loved in The Iron Patriot. Bathed in her headlights, I tearfully bid this young woman goodbye for a few months before I would fly to her home state to visit her, leaving The Iron Patriot alone for five days to relax under a low autumn sun. The Iron Patriot, through all of this life experience, saw it all. They saw objects or places can sometimes become haunted if they see enough emotional anguish or energy, so I’d say that there’s a good shot that today some poor kid has a haunted, fourteen-year-old CR-V.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the aforementioned long distance relationship came to a close. It was late one Sunday night (or Monday morning, depending on your point of view) in early January. I was sitting in my car after a late, lone viewing of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning performance in <em>The Revenant.</em> My long term, long distance relationship was about to end. I knew it, and she knew it. We’d hardly spoken for six days. I decided that it was a good time to reach out and say “hey,” while sitting alone in my car at 1:30 in the morning.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ring.</em> Nothing. Listening to the dial tone, I stared at the front of the theater through The Iron Patriot’s frost-covered windshield.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ring.</em> Still nothing. Light snow had began to fall, reflecting color in all directions as it glided softly down in front of the theater’s blue neon letters.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ri—</em> “Hello?” her voice sounded tired.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” I said back.</p>\n<p>“What’s up?”</p>\n<p>“I, uh, just got out of a movie. Thought I’d see what’s up.”</p>\n<p>“Thought you’d see what’s up, huh?”</p>\n<p>“Yep.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I just got into bed. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, uh…okay. Bye. I love y—” the line was dead.</p>\n<p>I threw my phone into the back seat and punched the ceiling of my poor Rhonda as hard as I could, making a slight dent. She was Rhonda to me that night, after an extremely intimate and emotional experience she and I shared together that I somehow coped with alone.</p>\n<p>I sat in the lot for a while, caressing my now-red knuckles and enjoying the silence and the snow. I watched the last of the cars pull out of the lot as a thin, powdery white built on Rhonda’s windshield wipers. I watched cracks in the asphalt fill up while the rest of the tarmac sat speckled and frozen like the crusted surface of an icy sea. I watched the neon blue letters spelling CARMIKE flicker and turn off as the snow piled softly on top of them. When it reached half an inch, I decided I’d stop wallowing in self-pity and go home. The world was cold, but life went on.</p>\n<p>The next few months were weird. I was in school, sure, and working, but I got it in my head that I should start looking for a different car. Not a new one, I had an idea of what I wanted (preferably late-‘90s or early 2000s Hondas), but a different car. I knew I was going to be getting rid of The Iron Patriot. A few times I stopped and told myself I’d drive her until she died and I was <em>forced</em> to get rid of her, but the desire to get something else always won out. My parents were really on the side of me getting a new car too; they’d worried about their only child driving a fourteen-year-old crossover whose steering wheel shook past fifty miles an hour up and down the highway seven days a week all over and through the dips and bends of New Jersey. I can’t say that I blame them looking back.</p>\n<p>In late May of last year, Honda’s newly redesigned Civic coupes went on sale. One of the colors was an obnoxious “energy green pearl” as deemed by Honda, and I was hooked. I was willing to get rid of my beloved Patriot for this green…thing. A Friday in early June my father accompanied me to a nearby Honda dealership where I would seal the deal. I was getting rid of Rhonda. I test drove this green Civic and was happy enough with it. It was fast (although fast to me after driving The Iron Patriot for three years could have been a wheelchair on ice), nimble, and quiet. I was sold. It would help me build credit. It was much better on gas, much more attractive, and way safer. What could go wrong? What was wrong with this plan? There was nary a doubt in my mind that this was the right call and so I decided to sell The Iron Patriot and use that money as a downpayment on this new Civic I had started to call Maxine.</p>\n<p>About three quarters of the way through the dealings, I was hit with incredible remorse. I was actually going to have to leave my Rhonda behind. My back was to the dealership’s outer windows where she sat in the rain, staring in at me. I made the mistake of turning around to look at her and started to sob. Not a quiet, remorseful sob, but rather a loud and ugly one. That car was the only thing besides my parents to be constant in my life for seventy percent of it. I sobbed harder and harder and still she sat staring at me, rain collecting on her windshield and hood. Her big, triangular headlights gleamed brightly at me as they became covered in rain. It looked like she was crying too. I couldn’t believe how attached I was to her; I never thought the day would come when I would actually have to get rid of my Rhonda. My father tried consoling me but it was no real use. I was a wreck. He was emotional too, but not making a scene the way I was.</p>\n<p>I had left the table to go clean myself up in the bathroom where a kind old mechanic helped to console me. I was rubbing my eyes at the sink and washing my face with cold water when I felt a large hand pat me on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“You okay, son?” he asked me.</p>\n<p>“Y-Yeah,” I managed to stammer out. “I’m selling my first car. She’s been in my life for fourteen years.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” he looked at me with soft compassion and then smiled faintly. “I’ll take care of her for you.”</p>\n<p>I looked at him and tried to muster up some positive emotion but couldn’t.

Regardless of this heat, my grandfather stood peacefully beside my house dressed in his go-to outfit: a suit and tie. He was a gentleman; poised, yet brittle, and smelt of plants, spices, and smoke. With his hands clasped tightly together behind his back, and his toes as his single source of balance, he bent over to take a peek at our magnificent magenta roses.\n\nHe hovered over them and admired their aromas, just like we all do over a freshly baked batch of cookies. Then he pulled away, and with a crooked smile, pointed to a particular rose. I struggled to stretch my body far enough to view this unique flower, but once I recognized what made it oh-so “special,” I instantly folded back to the ground like an accordion. \nThere was a family of five bees on this one rose, and I thought one was going to go up my nose!  My grandfather thought differently. He told me, “If all of these bees are fighting over this single rose, imagine how exceptional its fragrance must be.” He seemed crazy, but after the monsters flew away, we both took a waft, and he was right. This freshly blossomed rose had an aroma that was sweeter and more elegant than any flower I’d ever smelt before; its perfume was as thick and rich as red velvet, and lingered within my senses even after I walked away. I’ll never forget it’s tantalizing fragrance.\n\nMy grandfather mastered the art of smelling roses. He shared tips with me, like, “The darker a rose’s color or the more petals it has, the more fragrant the scent!”  But his appreciation for roses was only a fraction of his overall appreciation for life. He possessed an innate empathetic nature, by consistently remaining present and assuring the people surrounding him that they mattered. Even as the sole breadwinner for a household of 15, he prioritized the time he spent with family, and noticed that the mundane moments in life are what made it so worthwhile. He emphasized, “Make time to share memorable experiences with others. Savor everything and everyone you’re blessed with. Be present.”\n\nAnd as I grew older, he told me, “You have to work hard and make things happen, but also, you need to take a step back and let things happen.” Our natural world’s beauty is temporary, our relationships with our friends and family are temporary; therefore, we should intend to enjoy whatever time we have. My grandfather deliberately lived by the expression, “to stop and smell the roses.”\n\nWhen he died, it felt as though every rose on Earth was ripped out of the ground. My family sensed the flower’s piercing thorns, rather than its smooth petals. It felt as though he took parts of my identity with him. I don’t why I recognized the subtle backgrounds in my life and their positive impacts after they disappeared. During the wintertime, I missed the fragrance of roses welcoming me into my household, and during family get-togethers, I missed the presence of my grandfather. Whenever he was near, he’d radiate warmth, making sure I feel at home. He made my family complete. I hated how our roses continued to bloom even though he was no longer here, but as time rolled by, the endless life cycle of a rose, through its birth and death, brought me relief. I gained reassurance once I realized that as long as the scent of my grandfather’s adored roses carries on, so will he.\n \nIt’s been 5 years since he’s passed, and now every time I see a luscious rose in my front yard, I take a moment to absorb its bittersweet qualities. His scent remains with them. It feels like he’s still here; still in his suit and tie, teaching me about the everyday beauties of the world. I believe that everyone should stop and smell the roses, because their scent is the most comforting scent in the world. \n","source":"SmellsLikeHome.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Smells Like Home\nauthor: Aisha Bilal\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: \naccenttext: Our natural world’s beauty is temporary, our relationships with our friends and family are temporary; therefore, we should intend to enjoy whatever time we have.\n---\nI strolled onto my front porch in a light cotton dress, and sensed the pounding hot fists of summer onto my body.

Dante is, after all, literally walking in Virgil’s wake for the entirety of the *Inferno*, and Virgil’s *Aeneid* makes all of Homer’s doubts about the figure explicit, dubbing him “that ringleader of atrocity” (6.709). Homer’s Odysseus is hardly a figure without ambiguity--this is a man who spends the entirety of the *Odyssey’s* twenty-second book murdering men who scarcely have a chance against him, aided as he is by a goddess and hardened by years of war. Leodes has his pleas for his life met with a“lopping blow/ so that his head went down to mouth in dust” (350-370). He thereafter proceeds to directing the murder of Penelope’s handmaidens:\n>“These dead must be disposed of first of all.\nDirect the women.  \nTables and chairs will be  \nScrubbed with sponges, rinsed and rinsed again.  \nTake them outside, these women,  \nBetween the roundhouse and palisade,   \nAnd hack them with your swordblades till you cut  \nThe life out of them, every thought of sweet  \nAphrodite under the rutting sutors,   \nWhere they lay down in secret” (487-496).\n\nSo Odysseus seeks to humiliate these handmaidens before he has them butchered, sifting through the gore of their erstwhile lovers with the full knowledge of their own impending doom.  Thus, the reader of the *Odyssey* is confronted with a bizarre paradox: a man who slaughters suppliants who beg for their lives, and mercilessly orders the deaths of women who, given their servant status, are likely enslaved and therefore entirely unguarded against his whims;  yet this man has the tacit approval of heaven. It is the daughter of the highest god who has aided his journey thus far, and encourages and aids the slaughter (Athena in fact facilitates the test of the bow to “usher bloody slaughter in” at the beginning of Book Twenty-One). Even Virgil’s mutilated Deiphobus gives Ulysses a tacit connection to the heavens: his full nomenclature of Ulysses is, in fact, “that ringleader of atrocity...of the windking’s line (6.709-10). The “windking” being Zeus, the highest of gods (and “son of Laertes in the line of Zeus” is a frequent refrain throughout the Odyssey, another reinforcement of Odysseus’s connection with heaven). This is a strange juxtaposition to encounter, especially for a modern reader, one trained to associate the divine and the heavens with unambiguous moral purity. The presence of Ulysses in Dante’s hell therefore marks a significant change in thinking about such a character. Dante does not merely suggest retribution for the figure’s mythological crimes by condemning him to eternal punishment, but thereby actively severs any connection between Odysseus and the divine that gives him the license to carry out the deeds for which Dante sees him punished.\n\nDante suggests that the greatest suffering of those condemned to hell is the separation from God. Dante’s vision of hell seems to take its inception from the Book of Matthew, in which hell is the “outer darkness” in which there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth,” itself an expression of the misery of being excluded from God’s circle of light (8:12). Dante establishes this theme early in the *Inferno*. His fourth canto sees the Classical poets, although better off by far than the lower circle, condemned by having lived before Christ. Virgil tells Dante:\n>“Though they [the virtuous pagans] have merit,  \nThat is not enough, for they were unbaptized,  \nDenied the gateway to the faith you profess.  \nAnd if they lived before the Christians lived,   \nThey did not worship God aright.  \nAnd among these I am one.  \nFor such defects, and for no other fault,   \nWe are lost, and afflicted but in this,  \nThat without hope we live in longing” (34-42).   \n\nThe “longing” in which these shades live is the longing for God. Their punishment is only to be excluded from such a presence. This fundamental absence of God’s presence is represented throughout by persistent assault on the senses, the presence of foul smells and a suggestion of cloying darkness. In Dante’s fifth canto, in which one finds the circle of the lustful, note is taken of the “malignant air” (86). His eighteenth canto doubles down on this motif: some of the damned are “snuffling with their snouts,” and this motion invokes the images of pigs, often associated with filth (104). “The banks...were coated with a mould/ offending eyes and nose” (104, 106-8). The flatterers and panderers dwell in excrement (113). What the absence of God suggests to Dante is filth and sickness, the inverse of the light and health with which he associates the divine.\n\nIt is the establishment of this theme of distance from God that makes the presence of Ulysses remarkable. After having seen Ulysses’ persistent association with the divine, even in Virgil, in which he is also explicitly condemned for his crimes against the Trojans, it is worth noting that Dante explicitly aligns God against Ulysses. Of Ulysses Virgil says: “Within this flame find torment/ Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired/ In God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath” (26.55-7). For Dante to completely divorce Ulysses from his associations with the divine is to represent a significant change in the way such a character is viewed. Ulysses has, in effect, gone from being a descendent of the highest god, favored and protected by the daughter goddess of the highest god, to being explicitly on the receiving end of the wrath of Dante’s God. The travails of Odysseus and his fellow Greeks are implied to be vengeance for the horrors committed at Troy, a city built by gods. But throughout his travails, Odysseus is never fully separated from the divine in a way that, to Dante, means punishment. On his journey, Odysseus also receives favor from divine figures like Circe and Calypso, even as he receives rancor from figures like Poseidon. Dante casts Ulysses thoroughly out from the graces of the divine, resulting in his eternal condemnation. Even Poseidon’s wrath was impermanent, as was Odysseus’s exile from home. The exile which Dante presents is of a more permanent nature. Since Dante’s hell is a place of exile from God and the divine, for Ulysses to be there represents a change in the way God is viewed.\n\nFor Odysseus to have offended Poseidon, as he does by blinding Polyphemus in Book Nine of the *Odyssey*, is to have alienated himself from one god. The persistent aid of Athena and other divine forces suggests that in a polytheistic religious system, alienation from one god will not result in entire alienation from divine forces and their graces. The naming of Ulysses as being in the line of the “windking” (Zeus) in the *Aeneid* maintains a sense of his being guarded and enclosed by his association with divine forces. This suggests that the scorn of Deiphobus’ shade can do little to touch such a figure, since he is still within “the line of Zeus.” But, of course, within Dante’s religious system, there is but one God rather than a host of them, and to alienate oneself from this God leaves one outside the circle of the divine entirely. The presence of Ulysses in the *Inferno* therefore suggests a drastic change in the view of the divine through the view of one mythological figure. A massive change in the conception of morality is suggested as well. Since, in the polytheistic Greek system one can carry out morally questionable or outright reprehensible behavior and still be likely to retain the favor of some divine forces, as indeed Odysseus does, then this indicates differing sets of rules of conduct that are highly context-dependent. Dante, on the other hand, reveals the change inherent in the Judeo-Christian system and its effect on the conception of morality: one God, and the one unifying set of moral rules and rules of conduct that having one divine force suggests. Ulysses is therefore unshielded by fragmented divine forces from retribution for his conduct in Dante’s view. Having alienated what Dante sees as the only God, Ulysses has effectually been alienated, cast out, from the divine itself. The guard of Athena can hardly be useful to Ulysses in the moral universe of Dante, who would undoubtedly have seen the goddess as part of the cadre of “false and lying gods” which Virgil repudiates (1.72).\n\nThe final fatal journey which Ulysses recounts to Virgil and Dante is itself an important expression of this separation from the divine. His presence in a lower circle of hell than the virtuous pagans is especially noteworthy, as this separation is itself only a further extension of Ulysses’ separation from the divine.  In Dante’s Twenty-Sixth Canto, Ulysses recalls his desire to exceed the boundaries of mortal exploration and knowledge:\n>“Not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty  \nToward my aged father, nor love I owed  \nPenelope that would have made her glad  \nCould overcome the fervor that was mine   \nTo gain experience of the world   \nAnd learn about man’s vices, and his worth…  \nI and my shipmates had grown old and slow  \nBy the time we reached the narrow strait  \nWhere Hercules marked off the limits,  \nWarning all men to go no farther” (94-109).\n\nUlysses has been explicitly condemned to the circle of the fraudulent because of the Trojan Horse, but his final journey represents an implicit reason for punishment as well: Ulysses has pushed against the boundaries of mortality, seeking out knowledge reserved for the divine alone. Ulysses goes on to encourage his men to seek out the world where “no one lives,” a further implication of this realm’s prohibition against mortal knowledge (117). Here, Dante has placed Ulysses again beyond the ken of the divine, implicitly associating him with mortality, and further dissociating him from the privileges of divine knowledge. Ulysses admonishes the reluctance of his men: “Consider how your souls were sown/ you were not made to live like brutes or beasts/ but to pursue virtue and knowledge” (118-20). Here, Ulysses is implicitly encouraging the transgression of a boundary between the divine and the mortal. His pursuit of divine knowledge recalls the transgression of Adam and Eve, eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and being subsequently brutally punished for their attempt to access something which can only be the province of God. The dashing to pieces of Ulysses’ ship represents the final divorce of this figure from any divine connections (138). Dante thoroughly reinforces Ulysses’ mortality and exclusion from the realm of the divine not merely with his God-ordained punishment in hell, but with his death, resulting as it does from Ulysses’ attempt to grasp an understanding from which he is excluded by dint of being mortal.     \n\nThe presence of Ulysses in the hell built by Dante is both a commentary on the Classical tradition of such a figure as well as an indicator of the vast change in moral systems represented by the Judeo-Christian tradition within which Dante is working. While Virgil condemns Odysseus for his crimes against the Trojans, he nevertheless maintains a tacit connection between this figure and the divine. Dante does something entirely new by completely divorcing this figure from the divine, and in Dante’s view, therefore any connection to approval or heroism. The presence of Ulysses is a more subtle expression of Dante’s disapproval for the “false and lying gods” of the Greco-Roman world. Dante re-appropriates a figure which had formerly enjoyed some approval by the heavens, however ambiguously he was represented, and thoroughly out casts him from the circle of divine regard. Dante is, through this re-contextualization, representing the shift from the polytheistic system of ancient Greece to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which one must follow a unifying set of rules in order to avert permanently alienating oneself from the singular divine force which governs Dante’s universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Works Cited\nDante.

Dante is, after all, literally walking in Virgil’s wake for the entirety of the <em>Inferno</em>, and Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em> makes all of Homer’s doubts about the figure explicit, dubbing him “that ringleader of atrocity” (6.709). Homer’s Odysseus is hardly a figure without ambiguity–this is a man who spends the entirety of the <em>Odyssey’s</em> twenty-second book murdering men who scarcely have a chance against him, aided as he is by a goddess and hardened by years of war. Leodes has his pleas for his life met with a“lopping blow/ so that his head went down to mouth in dust” (350-370). He thereafter proceeds to directing the murder of Penelope’s handmaidens:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“These dead must be disposed of first of all.<br>Direct the women.<br>Tables and chairs will be<br>Scrubbed with sponges, rinsed and rinsed again.<br>Take them outside, these women,<br>Between the roundhouse and palisade,<br>And hack them with your swordblades till you cut<br>The life out of them, every thought of sweet<br>Aphrodite under the rutting sutors,<br>Where they lay down in secret” (487-496).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Odysseus seeks to humiliate these handmaidens before he has them butchered, sifting through the gore of their erstwhile lovers with the full knowledge of their own impending doom.  Thus, the reader of the <em>Odyssey</em> is confronted with a bizarre paradox: a man who slaughters suppliants who beg for their lives, and mercilessly orders the deaths of women who, given their servant status, are likely enslaved and therefore entirely unguarded against his whims;  yet this man has the tacit approval of heaven. It is the daughter of the highest god who has aided his journey thus far, and encourages and aids the slaughter (Athena in fact facilitates the test of the bow to “usher bloody slaughter in” at the beginning of Book Twenty-One). Even Virgil’s mutilated Deiphobus gives Ulysses a tacit connection to the heavens: his full nomenclature of Ulysses is, in fact, “that ringleader of atrocity…of the windking’s line (6.709-10). The “windking” being Zeus, the highest of gods (and “son of Laertes in the line of Zeus” is a frequent refrain throughout the Odyssey, another reinforcement of Odysseus’s connection with heaven). This is a strange juxtaposition to encounter, especially for a modern reader, one trained to associate the divine and the heavens with unambiguous moral purity. The presence of Ulysses in Dante’s hell therefore marks a significant change in thinking about such a character. Dante does not merely suggest retribution for the figure’s mythological crimes by condemning him to eternal punishment, but thereby actively severs any connection between Odysseus and the divine that gives him the license to carry out the deeds for which Dante sees him punished.</p>\n<p>Dante suggests that the greatest suffering of those condemned to hell is the separation from God. Dante’s vision of hell seems to take its inception from the Book of Matthew, in which hell is the “outer darkness” in which there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth,” itself an expression of the misery of being excluded from God’s circle of light (8:12). Dante establishes this theme early in the <em>Inferno</em>. His fourth canto sees the Classical poets, although better off by far than the lower circle, condemned by having lived before Christ. Virgil tells Dante:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Though they [the virtuous pagans] have merit,<br>That is not enough, for they were unbaptized,<br>Denied the gateway to the faith you profess.<br>And if they lived before the Christians lived,<br>They did not worship God aright.<br>And among these I am one.<br>For such defects, and for no other fault,<br>We are lost, and afflicted but in this,<br>That without hope we live in longing” (34-42).   </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “longing” in which these shades live is the longing for God. Their punishment is only to be excluded from such a presence. This fundamental absence of God’s presence is represented throughout by persistent assault on the senses, the presence of foul smells and a suggestion of cloying darkness. In Dante’s fifth canto, in which one finds the circle of the lustful, note is taken of the “malignant air” (86). His eighteenth canto doubles down on this motif: some of the damned are “snuffling with their snouts,” and this motion invokes the images of pigs, often associated with filth (104). “The banks…were coated with a mould/ offending eyes and nose” (104, 106-8). The flatterers and panderers dwell in excrement (113). What the absence of God suggests to Dante is filth and sickness, the inverse of the light and health with which he associates the divine.</p>\n<p>It is the establishment of this theme of distance from God that makes the presence of Ulysses remarkable. After having seen Ulysses’ persistent association with the divine, even in Virgil, in which he is also explicitly condemned for his crimes against the Trojans, it is worth noting that Dante explicitly aligns God against Ulysses. Of Ulysses Virgil says: “Within this flame find torment/ Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired/ In God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath” (26.55-7). For Dante to completely divorce Ulysses from his associations with the divine is to represent a significant change in the way such a character is viewed. Ulysses has, in effect, gone from being a descendent of the highest god, favored and protected by the daughter goddess of the highest god, to being explicitly on the receiving end of the wrath of Dante’s God. The travails of Odysseus and his fellow Greeks are implied to be vengeance for the horrors committed at Troy, a city built by gods. But throughout his travails, Odysseus is never fully separated from the divine in a way that, to Dante, means punishment. On his journey, Odysseus also receives favor from divine figures like Circe and Calypso, even as he receives rancor from figures like Poseidon. Dante casts Ulysses thoroughly out from the graces of the divine, resulting in his eternal condemnation. Even Poseidon’s wrath was impermanent, as was Odysseus’s exile from home. The exile which Dante presents is of a more permanent nature. Since Dante’s hell is a place of exile from God and the divine, for Ulysses to be there represents a change in the way God is viewed.</p>\n<p>For Odysseus to have offended Poseidon, as he does by blinding Polyphemus in Book Nine of the <em>Odyssey</em>, is to have alienated himself from one god. The persistent aid of Athena and other divine forces suggests that in a polytheistic religious system, alienation from one god will not result in entire alienation from divine forces and their graces. The naming of Ulysses as being in the line of the “windking” (Zeus) in the <em>Aeneid</em> maintains a sense of his being guarded and enclosed by his association with divine forces. This suggests that the scorn of Deiphobus’ shade can do little to touch such a figure, since he is still within “the line of Zeus.” But, of course, within Dante’s religious system, there is but one God rather than a host of them, and to alienate oneself from this God leaves one outside the circle of the divine entirely. The presence of Ulysses in the <em>Inferno</em> therefore suggests a drastic change in the view of the divine through the view of one mythological figure. A massive change in the conception of morality is suggested as well. Since, in the polytheistic Greek system one can carry out morally questionable or outright reprehensible behavior and still be likely to retain the favor of some divine forces, as indeed Odysseus does, then this indicates differing sets of rules of conduct that are highly context-dependent. Dante, on the other hand, reveals the change inherent in the Judeo-Christian system and its effect on the conception of morality: one God, and the one unifying set of moral rules and rules of conduct that having one divine force suggests. Ulysses is therefore unshielded by fragmented divine forces from retribution for his conduct in Dante’s view. Having alienated what Dante sees as the only God, Ulysses has effectually been alienated, cast out, from the divine itself. The guard of Athena can hardly be useful to Ulysses in the moral universe of Dante, who would undoubtedly have seen the goddess as part of the cadre of “false and lying gods” which Virgil repudiates (1.72).</p>\n<p>The final fatal journey which Ulysses recounts to Virgil and Dante is itself an important expression of this separation from the divine. His presence in a lower circle of hell than the virtuous pagans is especially noteworthy, as this separation is itself only a further extension of Ulysses’ separation from the divine.  In Dante’s Twenty-Sixth Canto, Ulysses recalls his desire to exceed the boundaries of mortal exploration and knowledge:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty<br>Toward my aged father, nor love I owed<br>Penelope that would have made her glad<br>Could overcome the fervor that was mine<br>To gain experience of the world<br>And learn about man’s vices, and his worth…<br>I and my shipmates had grown old and slow<br>By the time we reached the narrow strait<br>Where Hercules marked off the limits,<br>Warning all men to go no farther” (94-109).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ulysses has been explicitly condemned to the circle of the fraudulent because of the Trojan Horse, but his final journey represents an implicit reason for punishment as well: Ulysses has pushed against the boundaries of mortality, seeking out knowledge reserved for the divine alone. Ulysses goes on to encourage his men to seek out the world where “no one lives,” a further implication of this realm’s prohibition against mortal knowledge (117). Here, Dante has placed Ulysses again beyond the ken of the divine, implicitly associating him with mortality, and further dissociating him from the privileges of divine knowledge. Ulysses admonishes the reluctance of his men: “Consider how your souls were sown/ you were not made to live like brutes or beasts/ but to pursue virtue and knowledge” (118-20). Here, Ulysses is implicitly encouraging the transgression of a boundary between the divine and the mortal. His pursuit of divine knowledge recalls the transgression of Adam and Eve, eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and being subsequently brutally punished for their attempt to access something which can only be the province of God. The dashing to pieces of Ulysses’ ship represents the final divorce of this figure from any divine connections (138). Dante thoroughly reinforces Ulysses’ mortality and exclusion from the realm of the divine not merely with his God-ordained punishment in hell, but with his death, resulting as it does from Ulysses’ attempt to grasp an understanding from which he is excluded by dint of being mortal.     </p>\n<p>The presence of Ulysses in the hell built by Dante is both a commentary on the Classical tradition of such a figure as well as an indicator of the vast change in moral systems represented by the Judeo-Christian tradition within which Dante is working. While Virgil condemns Odysseus for his crimes against the Trojans, he nevertheless maintains a tacit connection between this figure and the divine. Dante does something entirely new by completely divorcing this figure from the divine, and in Dante’s view, therefore any connection to approval or heroism.
